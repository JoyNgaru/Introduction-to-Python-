**Control Flow**
Control flow statements allow you to control the execution flow of your Python program. In this guide, we'll cover the following topics:

**If-Else Statements:**
Learn how to use if-else statements to make decisions based on conditions.

**For Loops:**
Understand how to use for loops to iterate over elements of a sequence or perform a set number of iterations.

**While Loops:**
Explore how to use while loops to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a certain condition is true.

**Break and Continue:**
Discover how to use the break and continue statements to modify the flow of loops.

By mastering control flow statements, you'll have the flexibility to create dynamic and responsive programs in Python.
