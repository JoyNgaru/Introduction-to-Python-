Working with files is a common task in programming. In this guide, we'll cover the following topics related to file handling in Python:

**Opening and Closing Files:**
Learn how to open files in different modes, such as read, write, or append, and how to close them properly.

**Reading from Files:**
Understand how to read data from files, including reading line by line or reading the entire contents at once.
