**Object-Oriented Programming**

Python supports object-oriented programming (OOP), a powerful programming paradigm that allows you to create reusable and organized code. In this guide, we'll cover the following topics related to OOP:

**Classes and Objects:**
Understand the concepts of classes and objects, and learn how to create your own classes.

**Attributes and Methods:**
Explore class attributes and instance attributes, as well as methods and their types.

**Inheritance:**
Discover how to create subclasses that inherit properties and behaviors from parent classes.

**Polymorphism:**
Learn about polymorphism, which allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.

By understanding the principles of OOP, you'll be able to create more modular, maintainable, and scalable code in Python.
