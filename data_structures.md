**Data Structures**
Python provides a variety of built-in data structures that allow you to store, organize, and manipulate data efficiently. In this guide, we'll cover the following data structures:

**Lists:**
Learn how to create and manipulate lists, access individual elements, and perform common list operations.

**Tuples:**
Understand the differences between tuples and lists, and learn how to use tuples to store immutable sequences of values.

**Dictionaries:**
Explore dictionaries, a key-value store that allows you to retrieve values based on their associated keys.

**Sets:** 
Discover sets, an unordered collection of unique elements that can be used for tasks such as removing duplicates or testing membership.

By understanding these data structures, you'll be able to choose the right one for your specific needs and efficiently manage your data.
